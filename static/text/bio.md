##### About Me

Data Scientist with skills in Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQl, HTML and MATLAB from a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Physics from Gustavus Adolphus College and a certificate in Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp from the University of Minnesota. In a team of four, recently performed ETL on a set of data, setup a database, created a flask server with python, and used JavaScript to make an interactive dashboard with a map and other charts.  I work exceptionally well on teams and can be detail oriented when applicable. In all projects I undertake, I aim to enrich others with cohesive analysis and visuals. With my past experience with physics, theoretical mathematics, statistics and coding, I am confident that I will be a good fit in any team at your organization. I aim to hone my skills at programming and become the best I can be at it as I can be.
