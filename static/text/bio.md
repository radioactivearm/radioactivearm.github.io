##### About Me

Data Analyst with skills in Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, HTML, EXCEL and MATLAB from a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Physics from Gustavus Adolphus College and a Certificate in Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp from the University of Minnesota. In a team of four, recently performed ETL on a set of data, setup a database, created a flask server with python, and used JavaScript to make an interactive dashboard with a map and other charts.  I work exceptionally well on teams and can be detail oriented when applicable. In all projects I undertake, I aim to enrich others with cohesive analysis and visuals. 

I am quick at learning new skills and can adapt my current skills when challenges arise. In Python, I have experience with Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SQLalchemy, Tenser flow, SciKit Learn, and more. For JavaScript, I know how to use D3, Leaflet and Plotly, plus some built-in functionality for working with HTML. I also have experience in R, Tableau, MongoDB, SQLite, and VBA.
